-- | Ruth    | Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking
-- lot and drive away. If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars
-- that left the parking lot in that time frame.

-- | Eugene  | I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning,
-- before I arrived at Emma's bakery, I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief
-- there withdrawing some money.

-- | Raymond | As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less
-- than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest
-- flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone
-- to purchase the flight ticket.
